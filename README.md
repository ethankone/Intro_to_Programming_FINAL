Through this project I have gained a knowledge of the basic uses of Python, which I have used in this game:

''' CHANGES: 
changed background music
changed platform
changed character
changed background image,
added new powerup which lanches the character diagonally 
changed powerup
changed jump 
changed background color 
changed player jump height
created a christmas theme
Changed score color so it can be seen with the snow background

I attempted to change the main character with a new grinch sprite sheet that I found online, but struggled with finding the coordinates of each image

BUGS: 
-The game becomes a bit laggy the farther you go. I assume this is because of the amount of background photos.
-Sometimes the character will fall below the screen, but get shot back up. I need to change the play dimensions.

JOURNEY: When first introduced to this project, I wanted to attempt a top down game inspired by Call of Duty: Zombies. While researching how to do this, I quickly discovered that I did not have enough time to attempt this project. I elected to rejoin the class project and work with the code provided. Through my knowledge of Python, learned in this class, I successfully modified the game. I collaborated with fellow classmates on my ideas and debuging, as well as, helped others learn what I had done. I think this game is seasonally approriate and makes for a fun user experience. It has a modern twist with the music, combined with the classic image of the grinch. If you play the game long enough, you just might escape the Grinch. No one has ever been able to do this though. Merry Christmas!
